This Power BI project presents an in-depth sales analysis of AdventureWorks, a fictional bike and accessories retailer. The interactive dashboard provides key insights into revenue, profit, orders, and return rates, helping businesses understand their performance trends. It features a weekly revenue trend with a forecasted growth line, a category-wise sales distribution across Accessories, Bikes, and Clothing, and a detailed product performance table highlighting total orders, revenue, and return percentages. Monthly performance indicators track revenue, orders, and returns against set goals. Built using Power BI, DAX, and Power Query, this project leverages the AdventureWorks dataset to transform raw data into actionable insights.
